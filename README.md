services:
  app:
    image: _YOUR_APP_
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8088:80"
````

For pass data from tideways to xhgui just add **tideways.ini** to your Application


Below you can find default docs:



xhgui
=====

A graphical interface for XHProf data built on MongoDB.

This tool requires that [Tideways](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension) are installed.
Tideways is a PHP Extension that records and provides profiling data.
XHGui (this tool) takes that information, saves it in MongoDB, and provides
a convenient GUI for working with it.

Using Tideways Extension
========================

The XHProf PHP extension is not compatible with PHP7.0+. Instead you'll need to
use the [tideways extension](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension).

Once installed, you can use the following configuration data:

```ini
[tideways]
extension="/path/to/tideways/tideways.so"
tideways.connection=unix:///usr/local/var/run/tidewaysd.sock
tideways.load_library=0
tideways.auto_prepend_library=0
tideways.auto_start=0
tideways.sample_rate=100
```
